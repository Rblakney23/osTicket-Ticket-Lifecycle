In this example, Clark Kent is submitting a ticket to report trouble connecting to the company VPN from home. He selects the help topic: "Report a Problem / Access Issue" to categorize his request appropriately.

The ticket simulates a common remote access problem and demonstrates how users can initiate support requests when experiencing connectivity issues that prevent them from accessing internal systems.

Once tickets are submitted, agents can view them in real time through the Agent Panel. From here, they can monitor incoming requests, respond to users, and track ticket status.

In this example, we are setting the priority level of the ticket to High, as the issue involves VPN connectivity, which impacts the userâ€™s ability to access internal systems remotely.

We have also updated the SLA Plan to reflect the urgency of the request and assigned the ticket to a top-level technician for faster resolution.
